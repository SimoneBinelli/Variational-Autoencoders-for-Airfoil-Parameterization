Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised learning of airfoil geometries.

The model learns an 8-dimensional latent representation of airfoil shapes, enabling:

shape reconstruction,

latent-space exploration,

qualitative and quantitative interpretability analysis.

Post-hoc analyses relate latent variables to original design parameters (DOFs) using correlation and mutual information.

Purpose: compact, interpretable parametrization of aerodynamic shapes.
